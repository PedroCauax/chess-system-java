# ♟️ Chess System - Java

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a complete **console-based Chess System** developed in **Java**, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and exception handling.

The application simulates a real chess match, including special rules and game state validation.
